## 📌 Overview

This project analyzes **India's 2022 road accident data** to uncover meaningful insights using data visualization techniques. The aim is to help policymakers, urban planners, and traffic management authorities make informed decisions by visualizing key accident patterns.

---

## 🧠 Objectives

- Perform **data cleaning and preprocessing** on official road accident datasets.
- Use **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** to identify trends and patterns.
- Create **interactive and static visualizations** to highlight accident-prone regions, causes, time-based distributions, and vehicle-type involvement.

---

## 📊 Key Features

- **State-wise and region-wise accident trends**
- **Time-of-day and weekday distribution** of accidents
- **Vehicle-type involvement** analysis
- **Fatality and severity trends** by demographics and region
- Visualizations using **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn**
- **Google Colab**-based interface for ease of collaboration and interactivity
